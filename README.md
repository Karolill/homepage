# Homepage

In this project I will create my homepage, so that you can se who I am. It will be gradually updated with time. 
At the moment, the homepage is good on computers, but in the future I will focus on making the design more responsive.

I started this project using create react app, and you can see my homepage at https://karolill.github.io/homepage/.
